xmplay
======

An incredibly simple XM (and other format) player for Sega Naomi. Set up your toolchain and environment at https://github.com/DragonMinded/netboot/tree/trunk/homebrew and then add an XM file named noel.xm to the `romfs/` folder and compile with make. Then you can load this into Demul or onto actual hardware with a net dimm and listen!

Coming soon is the ability to select a module from a list of directories and play that.
